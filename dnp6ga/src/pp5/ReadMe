Code Generation

Assumptions:

1] If an array is not allocated space, the location of variable will be garbage. Using a variable of type array without allocation leads to errors.
2] An extra line of TAC code is generated when assigning values to members of a class 'using' this pointer. (Does not affect output)
   As a result some of the Frame sizes in TAC code may not match those in the TAC code generated by the solution provided.
